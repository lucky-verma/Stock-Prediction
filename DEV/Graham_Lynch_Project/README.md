# Graham-Lynch Stock Interface
***

This repository performs three functionalities.

Using *Yahoo Finance*, I query over 3000 stock into Python's library, SQLite. Also, it calculates the risk tolerance of the user. Lastly, it finds stocks that fit below the threshold of the user's riskiness.





# Installation
***
```
git clone https://github.com/alexguanga/Graham_Lynch_Project.git
cd grahamlynch/
python -m grahamlynch.userinterface.__init__
```

### Interface
The interface asks a some questions. These questions are generated from typical risk tolerance questionaries. After answering these questions, you'll be scored a __Risk Tolerance score__.  

The code can be located doing the following:
```
cd grahamlynch/grahamlynch/userinterface
atom gui_for_stock.py
```

### Database
The code to the database can be located using the following commands, if you're in the grahamlynch folder
```
cd grahamlynch/grahamlynch/
atom Database.py
```
In the interface, you will be given the option to **Retrieve** the information. If selected, you will restore the stock database. To query over 3000 stocks, across different features, this will take approximately an hour.
